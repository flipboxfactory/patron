# Installation / Upgrading

### Option 1: Composer
Composer is a simple, straight forward installation.  Simply run the following command from your project root:

```bash
composer require flipboxfactory/patron
```

&nbsp;

### Option 2: Plugin Store
Within your Craft CMS project admin panel, navigate to the 'Plugin Store' and search for `Patron`.  Installation
is a button click away.
